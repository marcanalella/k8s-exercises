Service Practice
================

1. Create a deployment using nginx image (use labels to specify the environment, type of application and version)

2. Create a service to expose nginx deployment

3. Open your favourite browser and go to the cluster ip (localhost on windows/mac, "minikube ip" on unix) and port to see nginx response
