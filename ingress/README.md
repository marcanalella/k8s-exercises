Ingress Practice
=============

1. Create and expose a deployment using some hello world image (version 1, env prod)

2. create an ingress that listen on port 80 and host name "hello.com" (edit your hosts file)

3. Open your favourite browser (or curl) and go to "http://hello.com/v1" to see if everything is working. ATTENTION: don't forget to implement livenessProbe
