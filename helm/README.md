Helm Practice
=============

Create a package that, when installed, provides

1. a Deployment with nginx
2. a Service exposing nginx using NodePort

After packaging, installing and verifing, uninstall the package, then:

3. update NOTES.txt to show how to provide a custom image version and a custom NodePort
4. package and install to see the welcome message
5. Uninstall.
